Inferential statistics is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution.
It is one of the two main branches of statistics.
1) It uses a random sample of data taken from a population to describe and make inferences about the population.
2) These are valuable when examination of each member of an entire population is not convenient or possible.
